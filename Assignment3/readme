# Assignment 3

## CSE
* The main script is run.py (prefer python3).
* Checkhost script search out all the online nodes from the allhost files and store it in the hosts file.
* Make sure to recomile the source using 'make' before executing it. (make is already there in run.py)
* Suffle the host file before executing, since 1 -30 nodes are usually loading with jobs all the time.
* The command to execute the plot script from run.py is commented. (Uncomment if all the required libraries are present)
* The program is generating 1 output file (time data) per dataset. (for PLOT)
* The plot file cseplot.py is generating 2 graphs, each containing 3 plots.
* Cluster data is saved in cse/data1/* && cse/data2/*

Note: Makefile is for CSE cluster only, for HPC make comand is in the run.sh (not for submitting)
## HPC
* The main script is sub.sh.
* sub.sh compiles the src and then calls hpcrun.py.
* hosts file will be generated which we need to be bother about much.
* The command to execute the plot script from hpcrun1.py or hpcrun2.py is commented. (Uncomment if all the required libraries are present)
* The program is generating 1 output file (time data) per dataset. (for PLOT)
* The plot file hpcplot.py is generating 2 graphs, each containing 3 plots.
* Cluster data is saved in hpc/data1/* && hpc/data2/*
